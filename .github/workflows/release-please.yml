# =============================================================================
#
# This workflow creates release PRs automatically based on conventional commits.
# When a release PR is merged, it creates a GitHub release with the changelog.
#
# Commit prefixes:
#   feat:     -> minor version bump
#   fix:      -> patch version bump
#   chore:    -> no version bump (unless breaking)
#   feat!:    -> major version bump (breaking change)
